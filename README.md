# consoleBreakout
Small game of Atari Breakout using the console window.

The console window that is opened must be 32 x 16 (width and height respectively) 

This is done by right clicking the console top bar > Preferences > Layout > Window Size

I reccomend using a Size 36 font to increase readability


Increasing the difficulty win increase ball speed, decrease paddle width, and increase the number of blocks on screen.
